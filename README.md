Trying to replicate code for proposed method of N. Ma, T. May and G. J. Brown, "Exploiting Deep Neural Networks and Head Movements for Robust Binaural Localization of Multiple Sources in Reverberant Environments," in IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing, vol. 25, no. 12, pp. 2444-2453, Dec. 2017, doi: 10.1109/TASLP.2017.2750760. URL: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8086216

The code is split in two parts. 

MATLAB handles the binaural file generation as well as the binaural feature extraction. Unfortunately, the data generated by the feature extraction process are very large files and can not be included in a Github repository. The data required by the functions are available online at the following links:

Surrey BRIRs: https://github.com/IoSR-Surrey/RealRoomBRIRs
TIMIT Database: https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC93s1
SADIE II: https://www.york.ac.uk/sadie-project/database.html

Python is responsible for training the Neural Networks and performing the final method evaluation.
